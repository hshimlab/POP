# POPs: Genome-Free, Protein-Only Phage Particles as Targeted Protein Antimicrobials

Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our paper titled "Targeting multidrug-resistant bacteria with genetic-information-free protein-only phages". This repository contains the code and data used in our study, where we explored novel protein-based antimicrobials using engineering and evaluating genetic-informationâ€“free, protein-only phages (POPs) assembled in cell-free systems and tested against E. coli.

## Repository Contents
This repository hosts the computational and experimental analysis for the study introducing POPs: T7-derived, non-replicative phage particles that retain receptor specificity while delivering antimicrobial protein cargo. Contents include:

### 1. Codes
Graph_Codes/: This directory contains all the scripts used for visualizing antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results. 

### 2. Results
Excel_Tables/: This directory contains OD600 values from antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) assays.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run the analyses, you will need the following software installed on your system:

R v.3.6.0
Python v.3.12.1
Matplotlib v.3.8.0
pandas v.2.2.0
